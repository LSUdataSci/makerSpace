## Create an ad-blocking pi-hole

Ads are annoying. This is a project designed to help stop them, by using the pi as a DNS (Domain Name Server) and filtering out the known ad-related domains. Multiple devices could leverage the same pi-hole, so get ready for your housemates to thank you. 


### official tutorial

The [official walkthrough is here](https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-hole-ad-blocker-with-pi-zero-w?view=all) and covers all the important bits. They talk about needing to solder the 2x20 pin header onto the pi, but we don't have to worry about this since the pi should come with the header pre-installed (the black bit with the 20 pins sticking out). 



**Note**: the code provided in the tutorial are terminal commands. This requires you to open up the terminal

Learning to write shell scripts or basic terminal commands will go a long way in making you feel comfortable working with the pi and give you a familiarity with the computer that is useful for loads of other compuational tasks. I always have at least one terminal open, and have largely stopped using a file manager to navigate through directories to open, create, move, or delete files, as all of this can be done from the terminal more quickly.
