## RGB matrix

This is another fun, largely open-ended, one.

[Tutorial is available here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/) and does not require any soldering, thanks to the hammer headers we ordered specifically for this project. 




Here is [another tutorial](https://howchoo.com/pi/raspberry-pi-led-matrix-panel) which differs slightly but has some good starter code and associated libraries for making the lights do their thing 






### Project ideas

There are tons of possibilities once you have the matrix connected to the pi + hat combination, including

+ ...tons of others! 




### alternative

If you were thinking of doing something at a smaller scale, we have some of these unicorn hats, which serve as a direct LED matrix with driver as a hat for the pi zero. Additionally, the hat has 4 buttons, so some simple games could be programmed onto this setup.
