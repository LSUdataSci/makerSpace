## Welcome to the LSU makerSpace page


### Background

makerSpaces are an opportunity for you to create, learn, explore, fail, succeed, and understand concepts in hardware construction, programming, and computing. We will use Raspberry pi microcomputers -- though let an organizer know if you'd like to do a deep dive into microcontrollers or other options -- to learn about the interface between hardware and software, by piecing together electronic components with our hands, and then programming our hardware creations to complete tasks. 

_There are limitless opportunities in terms of what can be created._









### Resources

Below are some links to check out to become more familiar with the Raspberry pi microcomputers. There will also be some books and folks to help you during the makerSpace activities. 

+ [Setting up the pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_8ZcPeaxcc)

+ [Getting started page](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started)

+ [Introduction to the Raspbian OS](http://www.raspbian.org/)

+ [Simple programming with Scratch](https://learn.adafruit.com/programming-with-scratch-on-raspberry-pi/demo)

+ [Programming in Python with CircuitPy](https://circuitpython.org/)
 






### Inspiration 

Below are some projects that we should collectively be able to push through, with some really fun outcomes. Also, once the hardware is in place, the coding fun can commence. For example, powering up and connecting a small LED panel to a Raspberry pi can be rewarding in itself, but once this is done, there are numerous possibilties of what can be coded into that setup (e.g, scrolling text, radio equilizer, Conway's game of life, rainbow!)

+ [The unicorn hat](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/hel/getting-started-with-unicorn-hat-mini)

Hats/bonnets sit on top of Raspberry pi microcomputers to offer some additional functionality. The one linked above creates an interface of a 7x17 panel of small LEDs and 4 buttons. This can be used for simple game programming, alternating between different light modes, etc. etc. 


+ ... more to come here, but let your imagination and access to Google guide you! 






### Example projects

_ Reasonable limits_: We're not made of money, so keep your project idea reasonable, as decided by the makerSpace organizers. Below are a few ideas which we have the ability to make, and to let you leave with to further tinker with and explore. 

+ [Build an ad-blocking pi-hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4)

+ [Create a controllable LED panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAIIapYDS0Q)

+ ... other stuff!








### Other resources

There are tons of resources on campus that you likely do not know about, but may be able to gain access to. For instance, the folks over at the [Communication across the Curriculum (CxC)](https://design.lsu.edu/student-life/facilities/cxc-art-design-studio/) office have access to 3d printers, audio-visual equipment, and more that could be helpful to you and your project.
